NOTE
  This flake is still a work in progress. As of the time of writing, only eris
  and moirai have been successfully ported over. My next job is to port over
  keres.

README
  Gaia is my opinionated NixOS, Home Manager, and nix-darwin configuration,
  built upon flake-parts and bundle.

FEATURES
  - Reusable module system for programs not present in nixpkgs or home-manager
  - Wayland-first configuration.
  - Cohesive styling (courtsey of Stylix, nix-cursors, and more!).
  - Useful packages for a range of systems.
  - Support for multiple architectures.

HOSTS
   HOSTNAME  | ARCHITECTURE    | NOTES
  -----------|-----------------|------------------------------------------------
   eris      | x86-64_linux    | Gaming Desktop: R7 7800X3D + RX 9070 XT
   keres     | aarch64-linux   | Netcup VPS 1000 ARM G11
   moirai    | aarch64-darwin  | M1 MacBook Air running nix-darwin

TODO
  - Ephemeral root and home.
  - Declarative partitions with disko, featuring BTRFS and LUKS encryption.

INSTALLATION
  I wouldn't recommend using the system configurations as they are tailored
  to my needs, however feel free to import the repository as an input in
  *your* flake to use its packages!
